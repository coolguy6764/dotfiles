Dot files for ubuntu/debian bash

## Quick Intro
The project includes a few . files to be copied in your ~ directory. 
It was created as a way to practice my sh writing skills. It's tested on latest ubuntu and debian.

## Functionality
- *Readable bash command*: Provides much info without being distracting
- *git*: Provides a clear overview of the local git repository. The feature is disabled for non-git directories.
- *dns*: Quick view of the machine's main IP and FQDN as it's returned by your main nameserver

## TODO
- Add some color to make dir, fqdn and ip a bit more prominent
